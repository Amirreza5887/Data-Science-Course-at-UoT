# Web Scraping and Introductory Data Analysis
Welcome to Homework 0, where we will delve into web scraping and perform an introductory data analysis. This homework will be a hands-on exercise that will help you become familiar with the process of extracting data from websites and conducting basic statistical analysis. 

In this project, our group of 3, have implemented a web scraping program to extract data from https://etherscan.io/txs to apply simple comparison between sample statistics data and population statistics. 
# Environment
For an easier web scraping we used Selenium Webdriver in this project.

# Implementation
When data collection is completed, it is time to clean the data and preprocess the data to get rid of anomalies and null values or errors. 
We used Pandas dataframe which is a powerfull and easy to intract with data structure in the world of data science to manipulate our data wherever needed.
